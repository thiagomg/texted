Why did I create one blog system instead of using some existing blog platform?

1. I am writing in some other platforms, such as [dev.to/thiagomg](https://dev.to/thiagomg) however if they lose their data or close their platform, I don't want to lose what I've written
2. I wanted to learn Rust, therefore I created a blog system
3. If I get the blog posts, with the way they are structured here and add to github/gitlab/etc, it will just work.
