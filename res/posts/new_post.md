# Post without header

This is not ideal, but it helps if you have many markdown files

How does it work? Open to learn, after all, more tag is supported.

How is the header being inferred?

* id -> auto generated
* date -> last modification will be used
* author -> current user
* tags -> No tags will be available... maybe in the future
