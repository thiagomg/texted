# How does it work?

There are two forms to create a post:

1. In the posts directory, you can create .md files where the file name is going to be the url
2. Create a directory with a file named index.md inside. The directory (or folder, if you prefer) name will be the url. You can add images inside the directory to use in the post

## Surprise!

In the post body, use &lt;!-- more --&gt; to indicate that the summary of the post ends. What's below that will appear only when you open the post

## What else? 

This is a regular markdown file
